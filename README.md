# Manfred Awesomic CV (MACv)📄 + 👩‍💻 = 🚀

Welcome to the first prototype of [Manfred Awesomic CV](https://github.com/getmanfred/mac).

This project is based on this [JSON schema](https://github.com/getmanfred/mac/blob/master/schema/schema.json). 

This App is a **work in progress** towards a standarized curriculum format. 

[By clicking here](https://beta.adalab.es/easley-s4-manfred/#/), you'll go to its latest version. Jump to the **Using MACv** section to get started.


## Repo instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

To make it work, you first have to install create-react-app by typing:
`npm install -g create-react-app`
Then, clone the repo & run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

In the project directory, you can run`npm start` to run the app in the development mode.<br>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

In the terminal, type `ctrl/cmd + c` to stop it from running.

To create your CV, there are three different ways:

1. _Easy mode_: click on the **Form** tab and fill the form fields with your data. 

2. _Advanced_: go the **JSON editor** tab and modify the JSON data.

3. _Pro_: create your own JSON following this [JSON schema](https://github.com/getmanfred/mac/blob/master/schema/schema.json), then paste it to the **JSON editor** text area. 

After following any of these steps, click on the **CV viewer** tab to see your changes.

Once on the **CV viewer** tab, you can print your CV or copy the inner HTML to paste it to your website.
